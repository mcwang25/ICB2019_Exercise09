The bar graph and scatterplot for the dataset tell two different stories.

The bar graph shows the average observation valuue for each region.

The scatterplot shows the distribution of observation values for each region.

The bar graph shows that each region (east, north, south, and west) has an 
average observation value of approximately 15, suggesting the four regions
have similar properties.

The scatterplot shows that the distibution of observations values in each
region is unique. The eastern region has a standard Gaussian distribution, 
or bell curve. The northern region has a roughly continuous uniform 
distribution certered around 15. The southern region has a bimodal 
distribution at the extremes. The western region has a uniform distribution
throughout the range of observation values.
